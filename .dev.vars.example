# Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .dev.vars for local development if needed

# NOTE: For this Cloudflare AI project, NO environment variables are required!
# Workers AI and Durable Objects are automatically available.

# This file is here as a placeholder if you want to add external services later.

# Example: If you wanted to use an external LLM instead of Workers AI
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Example: If you wanted to add analytics
# ANALYTICS_TOKEN=your-token-here

# Example: If you wanted to add authentication
# JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here

# For the current implementation, you can safely ignore this file.
# Everything works out of the box with just: npm install && npm run deploy
